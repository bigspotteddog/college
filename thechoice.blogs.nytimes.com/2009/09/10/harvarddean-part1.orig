<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>Over the last two days, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/thechoice">The Choice</a> has fielded nearly <a href="http://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/harvarddean/#comments">900 questions</a> for William R. Fitzsimmons, the longtime dean of admissions and financial aid at <a href="http://www.harvard.edu">Harvard College</a>. Some of you submitted personal pleas for admission &#8212; whether on your own behalf, or, somewhat alarmingly, on behalf of children barely out of diapers. Others sent along queries about affirmative action, legacy admissions, the escalating costs of an elite college education and just how Harvard decides whom to let in, and whom to turn away. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Beginning today, and continuing tomorrow and into early next week, Mr. Fitzsimmons will address at least some of these themes, and others. Some questions below have been edited for content and space. &#8212; Jacques Steinberg</em></p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Let me assume that 80 to 90 percent of the students who apply to Harvard are qualified and could reasonably be expected to do well there. They have good GPA scores and SATs. How does Harvard decide whom to admit? Are there objective criteria? If so can you describe them? Do you have requirements internally about the number of students you admit who want to major in a given subject area?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As the parent of three children my observation is that the process, as viewed by a student, is more a crapshoot than a rational, predictable process.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><cite>&#8212;Norman Gelfand</cite></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Our goal in admissions is to attract the best students to the college. Many people believe “best” ought to be defined by standardized tests, grades, and class rank, and it is easy to understand why. Such a system, another Harvard dean of admissions, Bill Bender, wrote in 1960, &#8220;has great appeal because it has the merits of apparent simplicity, objectivity, relative administrative cheapness in time and money and worry, a clear logical basis and therefore easy applicability and defensibility.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">While we value objective criteria, we apply a more expansive view of excellence.  Test scores and grades offer some indication of students’ academic promise and achievement. But we also scrutinize applications for extracurricular distinction and personal qualities.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Students’ intellectual imagination, strength of character, and their ability to exercise good judgment — these are critical factors in the admissions process, and they are revealed not by test scores but by students’ activities outside the classroom, the testimony of teachers and guidance counselors, and by alumni/ae and staff interview reports. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With these aspects &#8212; academic excellence, extracurricular distinction, and personal qualities &#8212; in mind, we read with care all the components of each application.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Efforts to define and identify precise elements of character, and to determine how much weight they should be given in the admissions process, require discretion and judiciousness.  But the committee believes that the “best” freshman class is more likely to result if we bring evaluation of character and personality into decisions than if we do not.<span id="more-7513"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We believe that a diversity of backgrounds, academic interests, extracurricular talents, and career goals among students who live and learn together affects the quality of education in the same manner as a great faculty or material resources.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">These considerations are guidelines that are neither comprehensive nor absolute.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We proceed with care, discretion, and humility because we know we are working with imperfect information and that no one can predict with certainty what an individual will accomplish during college or beyond. While we are heartened by the fact that Harvard’s graduation rate of 96 to 98 percent is always at or near the top of America’s colleges, it is clear that making admissions decisions is more of an art than science. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Harvard admissions officers, who serve as area representatives, read every application from their assigned areas.  They record all data, contact the applicant and school for missing materials, and comment on the application’s strengths and weaknesses.  Some applications receive as many as four readings and each reader checks factual data recorded and, more importantly, offers additional interpretations of the folder.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The standing committee on admissions and financial aid of the faculty, which includes about 30 members of the faculty of arts and sciences, formulates and implements policies on admissions and financial aid.  Members of the standing committee also review applications that are representative of the entire pool &#8212; and those which present unusually strong scholarly credentials, demonstrate exceptional creativity in the arts, or raise questions of admissions policy. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Working under the guidelines established by the standing committee, the admissions committee makes decisions on individual applicants.  The admission committee is comprised of the standing committee of the faculty augmented by about 35 staff members from the office of admissions and financial aid.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The admissions committee is divided into 20 subcommittees grouped by geographic region and representing approximately an equal number of applications.  Each subcommittee normally includes four to five members, a senior admissions officer, and faculty readers.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Once all applications have been read and the subcommittee process begins, the area representative acts as an advocate, and summarizes to the subcommittee the strengths of each candidate.  Subcommittee members discuss the application, and then vote to recommend an action to the full Committee.  Majorities rule, but the degree of support expressed for applicants is always noted to allow for comparisons with other subcommittees.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Subcommittees then present and defend their recommendations to the full committee.  While reading or hearing the summary of any case, any committee member may raise questions about the proposed decision and request a full review of the case.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Many candidates are re-presented in full committee.  Discussions in subcommittee or in full committee on a single applicant can last up to an hour.  The full Committee compares all candidates across all subcommittees, and therefore across geographic lines.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This rigorous comparative process strives to be deliberate, meticulous, and fair.  It is labor intensive, but it permits extraordinary flexibility and the possibility of changing decisions virtually until the day the admissions committee mails them.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Personal qualities and character provide the foundation upon which each admission rests.  Harvard alumni/ae often report that the education they received from fellow classmates was a critically important component of their college experience.  The education that takes place between roommates, in dining halls, classrooms, research groups, extracurricular activities, and in Harvard’s residential houses depends on selecting students who will reach out to others. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The admissions committee, therefore, takes great care to attempt to identify students who will be outstanding “educators,” students who will inspire fellow classmates and professors.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">While there are students at Harvard who might present unusual excellence in a single academic or extracurricular area, most admitted students are unusually strong across the board and are by any definition well-rounded.  The energy, commitment, and dedication it takes to achieve various kinds and degrees of excellence serve students well during their college years and throughout their lives.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It has been my daughter’s goal to go to an Ivy League school about as long as she knew she would be going to college. She is a Merit Scholar, school president &#8212;  I could go on and on. But we are middle class in California. We do not qualify for any financial aid, yet we can not afford to spend over $50,000 per year to send her to a private college. Have administrators noticed that the middle class are the ones who are being squeezed out higer education?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><cite>&#8212;Vicky</cite></em></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Promising students should never allow a lack of financial resources to stand in the way of reaching for their first choice college.  Harvard has made sweeping changes in financial aid in recent years to make a Harvard education accessible and affordable for families across the economic spectrum.  This year the undergraduate financial aid program is the most generous in our history with a budget of $145 million, nearly a 7 percent increase from last year and a 167 percent increase over the past decade.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For those aspiring to a Harvard education in these difficult economic times, our renewed program arrived at a crucial time.  The unwavering commitment of <a href="http://www.president.harvard.edu/biography/index.php">Drew Faust</a>, President of Harvard University; <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/home/dean-and-administration/deans-office/deans-biography.shtml">Michael Smith</a>, Dean of the  Faculty of Arts and Sciences; and <a href="http://www.faculty.harvard.edu/about-office/history-office/evelynn-m-hammonds-dean-harvard-college">Evelynn Hammonds</a>, Dean of Harvard College to keep Harvard open to talented students from all economic backgrounds sends a clear and compelling message to students and families everywhere.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Applying for financial aid in no way affects an applicant&#8217;s chances for admission.  All our financial aid is need-based; 60 percent of students receive grant assistance and about 70 percent receive some form of financial aid.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The new policy has three major components: </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The “Zero to 10% Standard”: Harvard’s new financial aid policy dramatically reduces the amount families with incomes below $180,000 will be expected to pay.  Families with incomes above $120,000 and below $180,000 and with assets typical for these income levels are asked to pay 10 percent of their incomes.  For those with incomes below $120,000 the family contribution percentage declines steadily from 10 percent, reaching zero for those with incomes at $60,000 and below.  For example, a typical family making $150,000 is asked to pay approximately $15,000 for a child to attend Harvard College.  Even families with incomes greater than $180,000 are eligible for grants if they face unusual financial challenges.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">No Loans:  In calculating the financial aid packages offered to undergraduates, Harvard does not expect students to take out loans.  Loans have been replaced by increased grants from the University, but remain available for students and families upon request.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Eliminate Home Equity from Consideration: Harvard no longer considers home equity in determining a family’s ability to pay for college.  This change has reduced the price by an average of $4,000 per year for affected families as compared with previous practice.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Many other colleges, public and private, have also made significant changes to their financial aid programs. Students and families can explore colleges’ websites to learn about the new financial aid opportunities that have emerged in the past few years. </p>

			<p>Having attended both a top state school and an Ivy, I can tell you that there most certainly is a difference between the two. I don&#8217;t think that most of the people who have posted comments have a grasp of the difference between kids who go to the top schools, like Harvard, and everyone else. This isn&#8217;t to say that these kids are better or worth more, but they are often much more gifted than your average &#8216;good student&#8217;. Harvard&#8217;s job isn&#8217;t to be the great equalizer; that&#8217;s what state schools are for. Harvard is out to cultivate true greatness by bringing together a cross section of the most brilliant young minds. And they happen to have a broader definition of brilliant than most of you who adhere to the SAT/grades racket; which is what makes them brilliant and leaves most of you outside it&#8217;s gates leaving messages such as these.</p>
<p>Many of the kids of parents who have been posting have probably been (or will be) hampered by the mindsets displayed here. This overemphasis on Harvard for 6 year olds will no doubt produce the kind of kid who doesn&#8217;t have true pleasures at which to excel, but who will instead spend the next dozen years cultivating some type of persona his/her parent thinks will win over the adcom. And for those who think that affirmative action is the reason their (white/male) kid didn&#8217;t get in or won&#8217;t, kids of parents who think like this are even less likely to get in. If Harvard accepted only the top students by virtue of grades and SATs, the campus would be swarming with Asians, not whites. Just look at Berkeley after the Baake case.</p>

			<p>No system can rationally choose &#8220;the best&#8221; 1000 applicants out of a pool of 9000 most of whom are &#8220;qualified&#8221; . Of course the admitted class is terrific by any test you can apply, but out of the same pool one could have picked  six other entering classes indistinguishable by any statistical standard you decide on. Solution: Eliminate the truly underqualified ( send them a polite letter at once)  pick a few hundred you really want for special reasons (plays the cello, star quarterback at high school, physics whiz, knows three foreign languages; etc.) Admit this group at once.  Feed all the other names into a computer program with many stated constraints to give some balance by gender, family income, race perhaps, home region, GPA, other quantifiable qualities,and total number to be offered admission. This &#8220;class&#8221; wiil be statistically indisinguishable from the one 34 deans come up with  after 1000 hours of headscratching and discussion. If this process is made transparent, no one&#8217;s ego will be bruised by being &#8220;rejected&#8221; by Harvard (Yale, Williams, Princeton etc).<br />
      I am a retired college administrator (Ivy League) of 32 year&#8217;s experience. I once made this proposal to an admissions officer.She said, &#8220;But that would take away my job.&#8221;  How true.       S. Riorden</p>

			<p>It’s a vicious cycle. People want to know how to get admission into Harvard. The NY Times publishes a Q&#038;A session with a Harvard dean. More people want to know how to get admission into Harvard, and the fact that every person needs to find the best undergraduate college for him or herself is lost in the media hype. </p>
<p>I was admitted into Harvard and Princeton a number of years ago. I went to Princeton because they offered me 50% more financial aid. I also preferred Princeton’s focus on undergraduates. Harvard has better name recognition because of the success of their graduate and professional schools alumni (and faculty, I should say). </p>
<p>Some people will be more impressed with you if you went to Harvard than if you went to Princeton than if you went to Podunk, including a number of people reading this article and these comments. That’s acceptable the first few years out of college &#8211; though I’d also add that if someone is more impressed that you went to Harvard versus Princeton then that’s not someone worth impressing (Those in the know&#8230;). More importantly, if you’re 20 years out of college and the most impressive one-liner you have in your arsenal is “I went to Harvard/Princeton/Podunk” then you haven’t really done much with that opportunity.</p>
<p>Consider this study by Dale and Krueger (of the Mellon Foundation and Princeton University, respectively). Brief summary: Students accepted at “highly selective” institutions who instead went to “moderately selective” institutions had similar income levels 20 years later as the students who did attend the “highly selective” colleges. Of course, money is not the determinant of success; it is just a quantifiable component.</p>

			<p>Harvard&#8217;s admission policies and procedures are no more or less thoughtful than any other college&#8217;s that deals with applicants as individuals rather than as data. Many years in the Amherst admission office and good friendships with admission officers from many institutions all over the country tell me that those in admission struggle constantly to make the &#8220;right&#8221; decisions for their institutions and the applicants themselves. It would be best for readers to consider Bill&#8217;s comments representative of college admission and not simply about Harvard.<br />
When I read these articles and responses I&#8217;m often reminded of the blind men and the elephant&#8211;we only know the small part of the creature that we&#8217;ve had some direct experience with. Really, there are no explanations for why things go the way the do in admission that will satisfy everyone&#8211;especially at ultra-competitive places. Into that vacuum will rush all kinds of &#8220;reasons&#8221; for what happens&#8211; alumni &#038; donor spots reserved for half the class, &#8220;minority&#8221; set-asides, etc.<br />
The best way to approach the college admission process is to be Zen-like about it: focus on the now and be fully present in everything you do; that way you will have lived the full life a college expects of you. Even more important, do not focus on the target&#8211;that is the surest way to miss it. Let it go and be secure in the knowledge that you will be fine wherever you go. That&#8217;s not just blather&#8211;as a high school counselor I&#8217;ve found that the happiest kids are those who know they&#8217;ll do their best wherever they go and who do not depend on external certification to feel validated.</p>

			<p>I am a graduate of Yale (undergrad and medical) from the 60&#8217;s.  I think I got in partly on &#8220;geographic distribution&#8221; although I did have good SAT&#8217;s etc.  My family was very working class and although they had to pay a lot I did have substantial scholarship assistance.  I graduated #1 in my class and have benefitted in innumerable ways from the incredible richess of my Yale education.  All professors, BTW, no grad students ever (except supplementary discussion groups).  And I agree it is nice to name drop, although I try not to do that.</p>
<p>All this said, both of our children attended smaller excellent liberal arts colleges and their lives are just fine too, thank you very much.  Way too much is made these days of the value of an Ivy League education.  It does not make you &#8220;ruling class&#8221; any more nor does it necessarily furnish your mind any better than alternatives.  And I don&#8217;t think many companies or professional groups care any more either.  Think about it:  the professors even at junior colleges are now of such high quality a talented student can get everything they need virtually anywhere.  Even, I dare say, online.  And as for learning from others about diversity and so on, well, that is a lifelong process for all of us.</p>
<p>The &#8220;elite&#8221; schools have become so difficult to get into, especially with their current emphasis on internationalism, that students should stop worrying about it.  Try if you wish but make good backup plans and you will be very happy and very well equipped for the 21st century.</p>

			<p>Mary Shelley&#8217;s &#8220;Frankenstein&#8221; is not nearly as scary as Harvard&#8217;s admission process, designed to construct the super-human organism called the Freshman Class.  What Harvard and other elite colleges dont get is that their hyper-competitve policies reward neurotic backstabbing cynical overarchievers and their largely affluent parents who can pay the price:  for expensive musical lessons, travel soccer, mercy missions to Africa, academic and admission tutors etc.  I&#8217;d like to hear one admission officer say it&#8217;s more impressive for a kid to get a job suitable for a teenager (lifeguard ?) and earn spending money (and learn the mundane lesson that you have to work for the things you want and live within your means) than work at an unpaid internship (that Mummy or Daddy arranged and support by giving the kid allowance $$ and a car during the year).   And Harvard&#8217;s acknowledged desire for superstars sends the message that even as a kid, there&#8217;s no time to smell the roses &#8212; you&#8217;ve never done enough, you cant relax, you cant just be a kid &#8212; it&#8217;s not enough to get straight A&#8217;s, you must take the most advanced courses in every subject whether interested or not (lacking interest itself is an academic demerit), with perfect SATS, you also must unique extra-curricilurs like playing symphonic cello in the marching band on the foot controlled non-carbon emitting platform you designed and built yourself.  From all accounts, heaven is not nearly as hard to get into as Harvard.  What&#8217;s that say about Harvard?</p>

			<p>As an 87 year old retired surgeon, the product of nothing but public schools through medical school and who has a grandaughter a sophmore at Harvard, I cannot imagine a fairer method to decide who will benefit from an education at that institution. The achievements of her alumni(ae) tell us loud and clear that Mr. Fitzsimmons is on the right track.<br />
Harvard did not climb to the pinnacle of world colleges by toadying to &#8220;prissy prep&#8221; graduates.<br />
As for simulcasting courses, those who advocate it miss the point that fellow students are teachers too&#8211;lessons being taught in cafeteria talk, the dormitory rooms, the playing fields. I have never been in favor of home schooling for that very reason.<br />
In this global economy, and we are all &#8220;emerging&#8221;, it is essential that our students &#8220;rub shoulders&#8221; with people of all lands. My friend, native of India, who has taken me there four times, tells this little fable.<br />
&#8220;Once there was a little baby frog who fell down a well. It was so nice and cool and wet there. He swam around his entire life, saying,  &#8220;What a wonderful world it is!!&#8221;&#8221;<br />
Harvard, America needs you and the ideals you stand for.<br />
NEVER WAVER!!!</p>

			<p>Mr. Fitzsimmons is an amazing gentleman who should be commended on his organization. I have dealt with him on a personal level, being on the Harvard&#8217;s Admission Committee as an interviewer in Palm Beach. I believe he is doing a fabulous job picking out the best students to represent the finest university in the world. Thanks William, our hats are off to you.<br />

			<p>My sister currently teaches at Harvard.  I am also an academic.  I admire the school and have no (real) problem with its admissions policy.  However, I nearly fell out of my chair reading this line:  &#8220;For example, a typical family making $150,000&#8230;&#8221;   This income level relates to no &#8220;typical&#8221; American family that I&#8217;m aware of.

			<p>When my daughter went to Harvard, years ago, I was told there was scholarship money for descendants of soldiers who fought in the Revolutionary War, and if I could prove it. I have 7 progenitors who fought in the Revolution and I have the proof. My grandson soon off to college and wants to go to Harvard. Is such a scholarship really available?  Diane</p>

			<p>I would like to thank Dr. Fitzsimmons for his detailed response to my earlier query. I would like to comment on his response and would invite Dr. Fitzsommons to comment further if he wishes.</p>
<p>It is apparent to me that dispite the exhaustive process that each appliction to Harvard receives, and as described by Dr. Fitzsimmons,, the criteria used in the evaluation the process, and the specific criteria used in each case to decide on whether or not to admit a student, remain hidden from us and the applicant. Thus most students have no rational way of evaluating their individual chances of being admitted.</p>
<p>I also would like to understand how an applicants choice of a major might affect the chances for admission.</p>

			<p>In response to A.L.B. (post #64), Evan M. (post#75), and anyone else who shares their false and insulting view of the caliber of the vast majority of legacy admits to today&#8217;s Harvard &#8230; I am appalled by your misinformed and insensitive assessment.</p>
<p>There is general agreement that at least 80-90% of the +/-29,000 applicants (using class of 2013 numbers) are actually &#8220;qualified&#8221; to attend Harvard, due to their exceptionally high grades, scores, and level of extracurricular involvement.  Therefore, it goes without saying that virtually all of the legacy candidates would be well-qualified, regardless of their legacy status.  If all else is equal, why should they be penalized because their parents attended Harvard?  In my experience, the children of over-achievers tend to be over-achievers themselves; they were raised with high standards, in an environment where educational excellence was encouraged and celebrated.  Many are minorities, athletes, and skilled artists. Why in the world shouldn&#8217;t a college accept these students?  what is wrong with wanting to continue a family&#8217;s legacy/tradition if the student in question is supremely qualified.  And yes, these students almost always are.</p>
<p>My daughter was such a student in high school.  She was a National Merit Scholar, a Cum Laude member, an AP Scholar with Distinction, etc. She also earned almost perfect SAT scores across the board (many 800&#8217;s on subject tests, etc.), and a nationally and regionally recognized singer and artist.  She worked unbelievably hard in high school, and also found time to volunteer for several organizations.  She is also a very good person, well-loved and respected by teachers and peers (ahh &#8212; there&#8217;s that elusive &#8220;character&#8221;  trait.)</p>
<p>She was accepted at every college to which she applied &#8212; Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Penn, Dartmouth, Brown, and Vanderbilt, despite the fact that she had no &#8220;connections&#8221; to any of the other schools, and was one of the thousands of white, middle-class females from New England to apply. </p>
<p>Her final decision to attend Harvard was, unfortunately, fraught with anxiety due to the very sentiments expressed by  &#8220;A.L.B &#8221; and &#8220;Evan M.&#8221; in this forum: she was afraid that everyone would think she got in because she was a legacy.  Fortunately, since matriculating, she has met a couple of other legacies whose accomplishments, skills, and talents are awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in the past, some unqualified legacies were admitted. However, recently, the bar has been raised to an almost unbelievable height. With today&#8217;s plethora of exceptionally qualified applicants, including legacies, who make up the applicant pool, the opposite situation exists.  Almost all of the legacies are supremely qualified across the board &#8212; perhaps better qualified than many other candidates.  Therefore, there is absolutely no reason for the college to admit any who are not. Sadly, the majority of these exceptional students will be rejected, simply because they ARE legacies.</p>
<p>Every Harvard undergraduate has the right to be incredibly proud of him or herself.  Each has worked unbelievably hard to earn his or her spot at this elite institution, and each  truly deserves to be there.</p>

			<p>As the father of two Harvard legacy students from a wealthy Westchester family I’d like to make some observations and offer some advice.</p>
<p>The first is that Harvard is a private school and can shape its admissions policies however it wants.   When the government adds it to its growing collection of corporations the public’s opinion will count.   If you don’t like their policies don’t apply!  This is true of every private school; not just Harvard.</p>
<p>Don’t ever buy into the notion that wealthy legacies are inherently unworthy.   It would be easy to launch into a long essay in this regard but let me keep it short:  The vast, vast, vast majority of legacies at top schools are more than worthy of acceptance.  In most cases the suggestion that they are not is a function of ignorance or class-related angers.  It is also a tool that helps parents whose kids did not make the cut explain away their failures.</p>
<p>Always remember that every child with a college educated parent is a legacy somewhere.  Most schools have some sort of a legacy policy.  If you would like to take advantage of that reality have your kids apply to YOUR school.  Don’t begrudge HYP kids their connection.</p>
<p>Understand that the same individuals that decry the legacy hook will rapidly change their tune when they finally get a kid in.   It is these folks that will shriek the loudest when it’s time for the grandchildren to go.</p>
<p>My kids collectively hold acceptances to 19 of the most prestigious colleges in the world and both choose Harvard.  It is still the gold standard for higher education.  VERITAS.</p>

			<p>I was in a position to make the hiring decision for hiring my assistant while holding a prestigious editorial job in nyc about 15 years ago.  I myself was young, state-college educated, and I sifted through many, many cover letters and resumes.  I decided to spend a few days sorting through the best 10 cover letters in order to determine who&#8217;d come in for an interview.  I look back now and see I was trying to be &#8220;education&#8221; blind especially given the fact that I was very proud of my state school.</p>
<p>Though cover letters were short and to the point, do you know that the best cover letters were almost all written by Ivy league or other big name school graduates?  And then I did favor looking at the cvr ltrs/resumes of people sent from my alma mater&#8217;s career office  . . . and not a single acceptable cover letter came through.  I was sad about this.  </p>
<p>Ultimately I hired someone from Stanford simply because he gave the best interview and followed up with the best thank you note and phone call.</p>
<p>So, it is not name recognition only . . . . perhaps there is a professionalism that is transmitted to students by big name advisors/professors, and by their fellow students, that makes reaching for the best named education most important.</p>

			<p>Some Ivy League colleges like Yale and Harvard discriminated against Jewish applicants before getting rid of those anti-Semitic policies. Has Harvard apologized for this injustice and what have you done to rectify this wrong?</p>

			<p>Reality on the ground is slightly different.  The admission officers charged with evaluating applicants &#8220;character&#8221;,  as often as not have no special qualifications and  little experience!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Let me assume that 80 to 90 percent of the students who apply to Harvard are qualified and could reasonably be expected to do well there. They have good GPA scores and SATs.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&#8217;m a Harvard alum (&#8217;86) and I&#8217;ve interviewed applicants to Harvard for more than a dozen years, one to three per year.  Three of my interviewees have been accepted.</p>
<p>Every applicant is interviewed.  There is no pre-screening of their records.  I do not think that 80 to 90 percent of applicants are &#8220;qualified and could reasonably be expected to do well.&#8221;  I&#8217;d put the number at 40 to 60 percent.  Which (a) is just my opinion and (b) is still quite high compared to the acceptance rate.  But I do think the applicant pool is not quite that strong.</p>

			<p>This is for Amy, #88. </p>
<p>Yes, Harvard makes mistakes, both on acceptances and on rejections. I&#8217;ve interviewed applicants for 35+ years, and seen the other interview reports from my city. Every year some students who seem wonderful to us don&#8217;t get in, and their interviewers are distressed. Every now and again a student gets in who did not impress his interviewers. </p>
<p>Harvard Admissions makes no pretense to having an infallible system, and would probably admit that all they can do is make their best guess. I tell every student I interview that the final decisions in cutting the class down to fit the number of beds available are often based on imaginary distinctions, and that no one who&#8217;s rejected should say, &#8220;Oh, Harvard&#8217;s infallible. I&#8217;m not as good as so-and-so who got in.&#8221; Instead say, &#8220;Well, they made a mistake this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>No admissions office can predict everything about a student&#8217;s future. One classmate of mine developed schizophrenia freshman year and has been institutionalized since. Some classmates fell into alcoholism and other problems. Some percentage of any class will not fulfil their promise, and some students who seemed less impressive at 17 will become major contributors in their field. As a Harvard graduate, I occasionally meet other grads who depress me because they feel that having been admitted to Harvard validates them for life. It doesn&#8217;t. </p>
<p>As several people have said, there are plenty of first-rate colleges, and for some students, someplace other than Harvard may be a better fit. They will still meet wonderful classmates and graduate with a good education. One benefit of a Harvard education (I have 2 Harvard degrees) is that you learn that it doesn&#8217;t mean all that much. </p>
<p>One factor in admissions for which I do blame the schools is that too many play the yield game. One year we had a superbly qualified applicant whose parents had been undergraduates at Harvard, and then gotten graduate degrees from Harvard, making this kid a four-way legacy. But she really, really, really wanted to go to Yale. Yale rejected her. The only basis I could see for rejecting her was that they looked at her Harvard legacy status, and said, &#8220;Uh-huh. If we admit her, she&#8217;ll just go to Harvard, and that will damage our yield.&#8221; She ended up at Harvard where she did well, and is now interviewing applicants herself. </p>
<p>Amy, forget about getting turned down by Harvard. In the long run, that has as much weight as whether or not you were the top student in your 8th grade class&#8212;unless you let it be a big deal.                                             David &#8217;63</p>
